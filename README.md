AutoRDF is an original open source framework used to make it a lot easier to work with RDF data from a software engineering point of view.
Building on top of the Redland software package, it bridges the gap between semantic web ontology and legacy object oriented languages,
by providing transparent access to RDF resources from within standard C++ objects. Its use of widespread C++11, Boost and Redland  make it
suitable not only for the desktop and server, but also to low computing power embedded devices.
